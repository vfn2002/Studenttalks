                    We have gathered some of the most interesting people from our university to give us talks about specific subjects under the wide main-theme "Future technology and society"!

                    Therefore you will benefit from this event in terms of having a look into what will be possible, and maybe what already is possible, in a technological perspective. The people performing the talks are DTU students, with a background in the subject area of which they're talking about.
                    You will also benefit from the event in terms of free dinner, beer and soda, happily sponsored by DTU Alumni.

                    The event will start at 5pm, and the speakers will then in turn give 10 minute talks. After every talk you will have the possibility to share additional thoughts, comments or ask questions.
                    This should make the event last until 6.30 pm, which is a perfect sandwich-time!

                    We will of course have the speakers stay for a beer, so that you have the opportunity to chat with them after the event.

                            Our everyday life is filled with small and big actions, that are taken on the grounds of fear-driven decisions and momentary laziness. This is the essence of instant gratification, and by being aware of this process, it is possible to go against bad habits and fear of difficult challenges.

                            Simon has a knack for details and paying attention to small things. This trait along with a passion for logical thinking has lead him to learn a great deal about how people think and behave in certain situations. He has learned about many interesting concepts about human behavior through reading in his free-time, but unlike most, he is driven to go test these concepts in real-life situations.
